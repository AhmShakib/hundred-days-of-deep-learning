# 100 Days of Deep Learning

Welcome to the **100 Days of Deep Learning** repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my personal journey through 100 days of hands-on deep learning. Here, I will upload everything I learn and work on during this period, including:

- 📚 **Course Notes**: Summarized concepts, explanations, and key takeaways.
- 💻 **Code Examples**: Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and experiment results.
- 📝 **Project Ideas**: Mini-projects, challenges, and practical applications.
- 🔗 **Resources**: Recommended articles, papers, and learning materials.

## What to Expect

Each day, I will add new content focused on deep learning topics such as:

- Neural Networks & Backpropagation
- Perceptron,MultiLayerPerceptron
- Gradient Descent
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Various Activation Function
- LSTM
- GRU
- Transformer
- Transfer Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Generative Models (GANs, VAEs)
- Model Optimization & Regularization
- And much more!

## How to Use This Repo

- Browse the folders by day or topic to follow along.
- Use the code for your own experiments and learning.
- Check out the notes for concise explanations and study material.

## Who is This For?

- Deep learning beginners looking for a structured learning path.
- Practitioners seeking code samples or review notes.
- Anyone interested in AI and neural networks!
